# geocode.city Autocomplete

Simple JS snippet to add a geocode.city-backed text input to an existing page.

## Usage

I'm bad at javascript (and worse at purescript) so this is an old-school
style of snippet: include it on your page, make sure you have an element
with id `geocode-city-autocomplete`, and we're done. If you have an api key,
have that element provide it via a `data-api-key` attribute.

For example:

```html
<div id="geocode-city-autocomplete" data-api-key="my-api-key">
</div>
```

The element would ideally be empty: the script replaces it with its
own input. All markup generated by the script has appropriately prefixed
CSS classes, so you can style it to match your own app.
